The recent 'Financialization' of commodity futures markets, increases in biofuel production, and climate change potentially have imposed profound shifts in the way commodity futures markets operate. This article examines the corn market quote-by-quote to develop metrics on liquidity and transmission of information. The metrics are based on insights derived from sequential trading models on single securities, index futures on a basket of securities, and special features of commodity futures markets. Correlation between quote revisions in nearby and deferred contracts measure information-based activity, and correlations between revisions of the time lagged nearby and deferred maturity measure the speed at which information is transmitted among the different futures maturities. Information-based trading results in near perfect correlation between revisions to bids and offers in nearby and deferred contracts. Within one second, information is fully transmitted from nearby to deferred contracts.
