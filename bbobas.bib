We develop an algorithm to overcome this bias and use it to estimate \{PIN\} for nearly 80,000 stock-quarters between 1993 and 2004. We obtain two sets of \{PIN\} estimates by using the factorized likelihood functions in both Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara (EHO, 2010) and Lin and Ke (LK, 2011), respectively. We find that the estimate based on the \{EHO\} factorization is systematically smaller than the estimate based on the \{LK\} factorization, meaning that there is a downward bias associated with the \{EHO\} factorization. In addition, we find that boundary solutions appear with a very high frequency when the \{LK\} factorization is used. Thus it is necessary to use the \{LK\} factorization together with the algorithm in this paper. At last, we document several interesting empirical properties of PIN. "

Moreover, another group of studies provides no systematic evidence of a relationship between positions of index funds and the level of commodity futures prices. The lack of a direct empirical link between index fund trading and commodity futures prices casts considerable doubt on the belief that index funds fueled a price bubble.},

We argue that financialization has substantially changed commodity markets through these mechanisms.},

Index position data compiled by the \{CFTC\} are carefully compared. In the energy markets, index position estimates based on agricultural markets are shown to contain considerable error relative to the CFTC's Index Investment Data (IID). Fama–MacBeth tests using the CFTC's quarterly \{IID\} find very little evidence that index positions influence returns or volatility in 19 commodity futures markets. Granger causality and long-horizon regression tests also show no causal links between daily returns or volatility in the crude oil and natural gas futures markets and the positions for two large energy exchange-traded index funds. Overall, the empirical results of this study offer no support for the Masters Hypothesis. "

The flows are not based on information about futures price movements but nonetheless cause increases and decreases in commodity futures prices when they are passed through to and withdrawn from the futures markets.

The relationship shows that under certain conditions, future price expectations will influence nearby futures prices and that a short-term relationship between input and output prices will exist. We demonstrate validity of the theory using a structural price model and then by means of time-series techniques. "

We only observe, however, significant volatility spillovers from corn to ethanol prices but not the converse. We also do not find major cross-volatility effects from oil to corn markets. The results do not provide evidence of volatility in energy markets stimulating price volatility in the \{US\} corn market. "

This way, we are able to investigate dynamics of correlations in time and across scales (frequencies) with a model-free approach. We show that correlations indeed vary in time and across frequencies. We find two highly correlated pairs which are strongly connected at low frequencies – ethanol with corn and biodiesel with German diesel – during almost the whole analyzed period (2003–2011). Structure of correlations remarkably changes during the food crisis — higher frequencies become important for both mentioned pairs. This implies that during stable periods, ethanol is correlated with corn and biodiesel is correlated with German diesel mainly at low frequencies so that they follow a common long-term trend. However, in the crisis periods, ethanol (biodiesel) is led by corn (German diesel) even at high frequencies (low scales), which implies that the biofuels prices react more rapidly to the changes in their producing factors.

Even though it is intuitively appealing, one problem with this hypothesis is that ethanol policies have been in place in the \{US\} for more than 35 years, whereas the run up in food prices dates back only to 2006. However, a significant change in \{US\} biofuel policy during that year provides an adequate framework to test for the existence of a structural break in the stochastic properties of the corn and soybean price processes. The results show that structural stability is rejected, and the transmission of oil price innovations to corn prices has become stronger after 2006 (no changes with respect to soybeans). There is also a significant transmission of corn price innovations to oil and soybean prices. Moreover, the data show evidence of a previously non-existent cointegration relationship between oil and corn prices. "
